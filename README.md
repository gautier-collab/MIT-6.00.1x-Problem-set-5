# MIT-6.00.1x-Problem-set-5-Encryption-using-OOP

This is program allows to encrypt and decrypt messages, based on object-oriented programming. It was created through the 5th problem set of the course "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" (MIT 6.00.1x) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. You can find the all the instructions for that problem set on edx.org.

Inside "pulled_repository_path"/program/program.py, you can create instances of the PlaintextMessage class for messages you want to encrypt, or instances of the CiphertextMessage for those you want to decrypt. The methods associated with those classes are fully documented.

To execute the program, open the pulled repository in your UNIX terminal and run the following command: sudo docker build -t mit-python-problem-5 . && echo -e "\n\n" && sudo docker run -i -t mit-python-problem-5
